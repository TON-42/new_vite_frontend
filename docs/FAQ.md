# ChatPay FAQ

## What is ChatPay?

ChatPay is a Telegram Miniapp that lets Telegram users monetize their chats by sharing them to help train AI. All chats are stripped of personal data through anonymization or pseudonymization. Users are rewarded with $WORD tokens, which can be easily converted to cash. Currently, the app is in the beta phase, so not all functionalities are available at the moment. Stay updated by following our social media, checking the roadmap, or joing our community on Discord.

## How does it work?

1. Log in to check the value of your chats.
2. Choose the Telegram chats you want to sell.
3. Your conversation partners are messaged for consent. Once approved, you receive a notification.
4. Chats are anonymized, tagged, and bundled into datasets.
5. As soon as the chat is sold, you receive your share of the revenue.

## What are $Words?

$Words is the token used within the ChatPay ecosystem. Currently, $Words function as in-game points that users can accumulate through their engagement on the platform. These tokens will eventually transition into a cryptocurrency token expected to launch at the end of the year. $Words can be used for various rewards and incentives within the ChatPay platform.

## How and where are my conversations stored?

At the moment, ChatPay does not store any conversations. We only store the chat identification number of the chats that users decide to sell. In the future, if participants in a chat decide to sell their conversation, it will be stored with all personal data anonymized to protect user privacy.

## Which form of anonymization do you use?

We use advanced anonymization techniques to ensure that all personal data is securely removed from chat conversations. This involves removing or obfuscating any identifiable information to protect user identities while still preserving the value of the conversation data.

## To whom are my chats sold to?

Chat data that users decide to sell is anonymized and then made available to interested third parties. These may include researchers, marketers, and other organizations looking for insights derived from conversational data. The specifics of each transaction, including the buyer's identity and purpose, will be transparently communicated to users.

## Why does your UI suck?

We appreciate your feedback and understand that our user interface (UI) might not meet everyone's expectations. We are constantly working on improving the user experience and are committed to making regular updates based on user feedback. Your insights are valuable to us, and we encourage you to share specific suggestions for improvements.
