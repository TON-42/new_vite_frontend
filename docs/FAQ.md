# ChatPay FAQ

## What is ChatPay?

ChatPay is an innovative platform designed to monetize your chat interactions. By using ChatPay, users can earn rewards in the form of $Words tokens for their participation and engagement in conversations.

## How do I get started with ChatPay?

To get started with ChatPay, follow these steps:

1. **Sign Up:** Create an account on the ChatPay platform.
2. **Engage:** Participate in conversations and contribute meaningful content.
3. **Earn Rewards:** Receive $Words tokens as rewards for your activity.
4. **Monetize:** In the future, you will have the option to sell your anonymized chat data.

## What are $Words?

$Words is the token used within the ChatPay ecosystem. Currently, $Words function as in-game points that users can accumulate through their engagement on the platform. These tokens will eventually transition into a cryptocurrency token expected to launch at the end of the year. $Words can be used for various rewards and incentives within the ChatPay platform.

## How and where are my conversations stored?

At the moment, ChatPay does not store any conversations. We only store the chat identification number of the chats that users decide to sell. In the future, if participants in a chat decide to sell their conversation, it will be stored with all personal data anonymized to protect user privacy.

## Which form of anonymization do you use?

We use advanced anonymization techniques to ensure that all personal data is securely removed from chat conversations. This involves removing or obfuscating any identifiable information to protect user identities while still preserving the value of the conversation data.

## To whom are my chats sold to?

Chat data that users decide to sell is anonymized and then made available to interested third parties. These may include researchers, marketers, and other organizations looking for insights derived from conversational data. The specifics of each transaction, including the buyer's identity and purpose, will be transparently communicated to users.

## Why does your UI suck?

We appreciate your feedback and understand that our user interface (UI) might not meet everyone's expectations. We are constantly working on improving the user experience and are committed to making regular updates based on user feedback. Your insights are valuable to us, and we encourage you to share specific suggestions for improvements.
