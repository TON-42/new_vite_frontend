# ChatPay TMA Frontend

The ChatPay TMA Frontend is a Vite React application that allows users to interact with the ChatPay backend. Users can see their chats and manage their data. ChatPay empowers Telegram users to sell their chats (cleaned of personal data) to train AI.

## Tech Stack

- **Vite**: Build tool.

## SDK: (@tma.js/skd)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tma.js/sdk]

For interacting with the Telegram Web App, there are two SDK options available:

1. **Official SDK**: Provided by Telegram and available at [Telegram Web Apps](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#initializing-mini-apps). This SDK is a simple JavaScript file that can be included in your project from [telegram-web-app.js](https://telegram.org/js/telegram-web-app.js).

2. **Community-Driven SDK**: An alternative, community-driven SDK is available at [Telegram-Mini-Apps/tma.js](https://github.com/Telegram-Mini-Apps/tma.js). This SDK addresses several issues with the official SDK, such as unproductive package format, lack of public review, use of vanilla JavaScript, potential security issues, mixed code quality, and more. It is written in TypeScript and provides modern development conveniences.

### Motivation for Choosing the Community-Driven SDK

The community-driven SDK, `@tma.js`, offers several advantages over the official Telegram SDK, making it a preferred choice for this project. The `@tma.js` SDK addresses various shortcomings of the official SDK:

- **Modern Package Formats**: Available in CommonJS (CJS), ECMAScript Modules (ESM), and IIFE formats.
- **Public Review and Contributions**: Hosted on GitHub, allowing developers to track changes and contribute.
- **TypeScript Support**: Written in TypeScript for better type definitions and development experience.
- **Security Enhancements**: Does not disable security mechanisms by default.
- **Consistent Code Quality**: Follows well-established coding standards and includes comprehensive documentation.
- **Optimized Bundle Size**: Built using Vite, ensuring a production-ready, minified bundle.
- **Component State Management**: Ensures consistent component states across application reloads.
- **Configurable Features**: Allows developers to configure CSS variables and log behaviors.
- **Asynchronous Initialization**: Provides control over the initialization process.
